Clarke found herself forced to lead a band of disposable juvenile delinquents as they faced death at every turn - from a world transformed by radiation, from the fierce Grounders who somehow managed to survive in it, and, perhaps worst of all, from themselves.Alternately challenged and supported by rival leader Bellamy, the two found common purpose: Survival. Through it all, Finn was helplessly drawn to Clarke, destroying his long-standing relationship with the brilliant young mechanic, Raven. Octavia got close to a possible enemy Grounder, Lincoln -- some say too close. Meanwhile, as The 100 fought for their lives on the ground, The Ark's situation was no better. Though Abby believed that The 100 were still alive, she didn't have proof and couldn't stop Kane's population reduction. The killing of 320 volunteers and the subsequent realization that it was in error broke Kane and enflamed a revolution on the Ark that Chancellor Jaha, despite his best efforts, was powerless to stop. Both on the ground and in space, the final episodes will reveal the true desperation of their plight, as our heroes risked everything just to stay alive.Noble sacrifices and heartbreaking choices changed everyone forever and left them scattered to the wind.

In the midst of the conflict, Roman, a 6-year-old Atrian boy, found his way to a shed behind Emery's house, where she protected him from harm, bringing him food, comfort - and friendship. In their brief time together, Emery and Roman forged a deep bond, but the authorities wasted no time tracking Roman down and capturing him in a violent confrontation. Emery has grown up believing that Roman was killed that day. Ten years later, the Atrians have been acclimated to life on Earth, but they are interned in a heavily-guarded camp known as the Sector to keep them separate from humans. Now, for the first time, a group of Atrian teens will enroll in a suburban human high school, with the goal of testing the feasibility of human/alien integration. The eyes of the nation and the whole world are fixed on this historical social experiment, an endeavor fraught with suspicion and fear. In the mayhem of the first day, Emery is amazed to learn that Roman was not killed by the authorities and is, in fact, one of the Atrian students. Their childhood bond is quickly rekindled - in a school and a society that distrusts everything about the Atrians, Emery and Roman have found each other again.
